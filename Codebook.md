# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set Code Book

####Abstract:
Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
	

The `tidy_dataset.txt` dataset fields labels.

## Subject and Activity IDs and Activity Names

* `Subject_ID` - The ID of the test subject
* `Activity_ID` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
* `Activity` - Activity labels
